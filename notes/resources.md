# Resources for Self-Study

Alas, looking at the list below, you may be struck by that constant hazard of living in these modern times -- paralysis of choice. Fret not, I have marked resources which I particularly recommend with a *, as well as comments on when I think it would be best for you to consult these resources, so that will whittle things down a little. Of course, you may (perhaps rightly) question my judgement; but then you'll be on your own :P

## Ruby
* [Ruby Monk](https://rubymonk.com/) *
    - An interactive Ruby tutorial, with good exercises, and different tracks covering beginner, intermediate, and advanced topics
* [Codeacademy's Ruby track](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)
    - Not necessary if you're doing Ruby Monk. I would recommend Ruby Monk over this -- more comprehensive and better exercises
* [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/)
    - different from typical coding tutorials; this one exposes you to various aspects of Ruby as well as the idea of *unit tests*
* [Learn Ruby (Test-First)](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) *
    - good set of Ruby exercises that also introduce you to unit tests (written in RSpec) and *test-driven development* (TDD). Definitely check this out. It's not too long either.
* [Programming Ruby](https://pragprog.com/book/ruby/programming-ruby)
    - also known as the Pickaxe book; it seems to be known as *the* Ruby book. Good for reference and digging deeper, but not free.

## Bash and CLI
* [Conquering the Command Line](http://conqueringthecommandline.com/book) *
    - Covers several Bash commands and how to use them effectively. This is excellent.
* [Bash Programming - Introduction](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html)
    - if you are *really* interested in learning more about the Bash language.

## Internet and the Web
* [The TCP/IP Guide](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_toc.htm)
    - this is a HUGE and comprehensive reference on the protocols that form the TCP/IP stack, the backbone of the Internet as we know it today. It is good primarily as a reference. I would recommend reading, or at least skimming, [Networking Fundamentals](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_NetworkingFundamentals.htm), [TCP/IP Protocol Suite and Architecture](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPIPInternetArchitectureandProtocolSuite.htm), [Internet Protocol Concepts and Overview](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_InternetProtocolConceptsandOverview.htm), [TCP and UDP overview](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPandUDPOverviewandRoleInTCPIP.htm), and finally [World Wide Web (WWW) and the Hypertext Trasnfer Protocol (HTTP)](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_TCPIPWorldWideWebWWWTheWebandtheHypertextTransferP.htm).
* [How the Web works (MDN article)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/How_the_Web_works) *
    - nice short overview
* [What is a web server? (MDN article)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server) *
